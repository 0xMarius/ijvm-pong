IJVM Pong
===========

Based on gamelib-x64, a bootable game library from the Delft University of Technology.

Getting started
===========
You need to ensure you are using a Linux distribution on a x86-64 architecture with a recent version of GNU binutils to compile. In addition, you will need Qemu or Bochs (emulators for the x86-64 platform) to test your game.

To build the game, you may follow these commands:

`

1. git clone https://github.com/0xMarius/ijvm-pong
2. cd ijvm-pong
3. make
4. make qemu

`

To test your code, repeat steps 3 and 4 to compile and run your game.
